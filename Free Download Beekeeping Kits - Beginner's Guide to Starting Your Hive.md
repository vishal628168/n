*   **Foundation:** Wax or plastic sheets that provide a template for the bees to build their honeycomb.
*   **Bottom Board:** The base of the hive, providing an entrance for the bees.
*   **Inner Cover:** A lid that sits on top of the hive body, providing insulation and a barrier between the bees and the outer cover.
*   **Outer Cover:** The top lid of the hive, protecting it from the elements.
*   **Protective Gear:** Including a bee suit, gloves, and a veil to protect you from stings.

## Setting Up Your Hive: A Step-by-Step Guide

Once you've chosen your beekeeping kit, it's time to set up your hive. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

3.  **Level the Hive:** Use a level to ensure the hive is sitting on a level surface. This will help prevent the honeycomb from being built at an angle.
4.  **Add Foundation:** Install the foundation sheets into the frames. This will provide a template for the bees to build their honeycomb.
5.  **Position the Hive:** Place the assembled hive in your chosen location, ensuring the entrance is clear and accessible.
