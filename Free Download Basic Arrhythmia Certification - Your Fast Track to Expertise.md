## What You'll Learn in the Free Basic Arrhythmia Certification Course

This course offers a structured approach to understanding cardiac arrhythmias. Here's a breakdown of the key modules:

**Module 1: Introduction to Cardiac Electrophysiology**

*   The Cardiac Conduction System: Explore the anatomy and function of the heart's electrical pathways, including the SA node, AV node, Bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers.
*   Action Potentials: Learn about the ionic currents that drive cardiac cell depolarization and repolarization.
*   ECG Basics: Discover how the ECG represents the heart's electrical activity, including the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave.
*   Understanding ECG Paper: Learn how to interpret ECG grid markings to accurately measure heart rate and intervals.

**Module 2: Sinus Rhythms and Common Variations**

*   Normal Sinus Rhythm: Identify the characteristics of a healthy heart rhythm originating from the SA node.
*   Sinus Bradycardia: Recognize and understand the implications of a slow heart rate originating from the SA node.
*   Sinus Tachycardia: Identify and understand the implications of a fast heart rate originating from the SA node.
*   Sinus Arrhythmia: Learn about the normal variation in heart rate associated with breathing.

**Module 3: Atrial Arrhythmias**

*   Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs): Recognize and understand the significance of early beats originating from the atria.
*   Atrial Fibrillation: Identify the irregular and chaotic atrial activity characteristic of atrial fibrillation.
*   Atrial Flutter: Recognize the "sawtooth" pattern on the ECG associated with atrial flutter.
*   Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): Understand the characteristics and management of rapid heart rhythms originating above the ventricles.

**Module 4: Ventricular Arrhythmias**

*   Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs): Recognize and understand the significance of early beats originating from the ventricles.
*   Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): Identify the rapid and potentially life-threatening heart rhythm originating from the ventricles.
*   Ventricular Fibrillation (VF): Recognize the chaotic and disorganized ventricular activity characteristic of ventricular fibrillation, requiring immediate intervention.
*   Idioventricular Rhythm: Understand the characteristics of a slow heart rhythm originating from the ventricles when higher pacemakers fail.

**Module 5: Heart Blocks**

*   First-Degree AV Block: Identify the prolonged PR interval characteristic of first-degree AV block.
*   Second-Degree AV Block (Mobitz Type I/Wenckebach): Recognize the progressive prolongation of the PR interval followed by a dropped QRS complex.
*   Second-Degree AV Block (Mobitz Type II): Identify the sudden dropping of a QRS complex without preceding PR interval prolongation.
*   Third-Degree AV Block (Complete Heart Block): Understand the complete dissociation between atrial and ventricular activity.

**Module 6: Pacemaker Rhythms**

*   Understanding Pacemaker Function: Learn how pacemakers work to maintain a regular heart rhythm.
*   Identifying Pacemaker Spikes: Recognize the characteristic spikes on the ECG that indicate pacemaker activity.
*   Common Pacemaker Malfunctions: Learn to identify potential problems with pacemaker function.

**Module 7: Treatment and Management of Arrhythmias**

*   Pharmacological Interventions: Explore the use of antiarrhythmic drugs to control heart rhythm abnormalities.
*   Cardioversion and Defibrillation: Understand the principles and techniques of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation.
*   Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) Guidelines: Learn how to apply ACLS algorithms to manage cardiac arrest due to arrhythmias.
