## Diving Deeper: A Quick Look at Key Design Principles

Let's explore a few of the key principles you'll encounter in the "Basic Principles of Design Book":

### Balance: Creating Visual Harmony

Balance refers to the distribution of visual weight within a design. A balanced design feels stable and harmonious, while an unbalanced design can feel chaotic and unsettling. There are several types of balance:

*   **Symmetrical Balance:** Elements are mirrored on either side of a central axis.
*   **Asymmetrical Balance:** Elements are arranged unevenly, but still create a sense of equilibrium.
*   **Radial Balance:** Elements radiate outward from a central point.

### Contrast: Adding Visual Interest

Contrast refers to the difference between elements in a design. High contrast creates visual interest and helps to draw the viewer's eye to specific areas. Contrast can be achieved through:

*   **Color:** Using contrasting colors, such as black and white or complementary colors.
*   **Size:** Varying the size of elements to create visual hierarchy.
*   **Shape:** Using contrasting shapes to create visual interest.
*   **Texture:** Using contrasting textures to add depth and dimension.

### Emphasis: Creating a Focal Point

Emphasis refers to the focal point of a design, the element that first attracts the viewer's attention. Emphasis can be achieved through:

*   **Size:** Making the focal point larger than other elements.
*   **Color:** Using a bright or contrasting color for the focal point.
*   **Placement:** Positioning the focal point in a prominent location.
*   **Shape:** Using a unique or unusual shape for the focal point.
