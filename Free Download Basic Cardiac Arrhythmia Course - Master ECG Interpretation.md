*   **Career Advancement:** Enhance your skills and credibility in healthcare.
*   **Increased Confidence:** Gain confidence in your ability to interpret ECGs accurately.

## Course Overview: What You’ll Learn

This comprehensive **Basic Cardiac Arrhythmia course** covers a wide range of topics, equipping you with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in ECG interpretation. It is structured to build a solid foundation, starting with the fundamentals and progressing to more complex concepts.

### Module 1: Foundations of ECG Interpretation

This module lays the groundwork for understanding the electrical activity of the heart. You'll learn about:

*   **Cardiac Anatomy and Physiology:** Understand the normal electrical conduction system of the heart.
*   **ECG Paper and Waveforms:** Learn to identify and measure different waves, intervals, and segments.
*   **Normal Sinus Rhythm:** Define and recognize normal ECG characteristics.

### Module 2: Basic Arrhythmias

This module dives into common and easily identifiable arrhythmias. Key topics include:

*   **Sinus Arrhythmias:** Understanding sinus bradycardia, tachycardia, and arrhythmia.
*   **Atrial Arrhythmias:** Recognizing atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and premature atrial contractions (PACs).
*   **Junctional Arrhythmias:** Identifying junctional escape rhythms and junctional tachycardia.

### Module 3: Ventricular Arrhythmias

This module focuses on potentially life-threatening arrhythmias originating in the ventricles:

*   **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs):** Identifying and classifying PVCs (unifocal, multifocal, bigeminy, trigeminy).
*   **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** Distinguishing between sustained and non-sustained VT, and recognizing different morphologies.
*   **Ventricular Fibrillation (VF):** Recognizing the lethal rhythm of VF and its immediate treatment implications.

### Module 4: Heart Blocks

This module covers different types of atrioventricular (AV) blocks and their impact on cardiac rhythm:

*   **First-Degree AV Block:** Understanding the prolonged PR interval.
*   **Second-Degree AV Block (Mobitz Type I and Type II):** Differentiating between Wenckebach and Mobitz II patterns.
*   **Third-Degree (Complete) AV Block:** Recognizing the complete dissociation of atrial and ventricular activity.

### Module 5: Advanced ECG Interpretation

This module builds on the previous modules and introduces more complex concepts:

*   **Bundle Branch Blocks (BBB):** Recognizing right and left bundle branch blocks.
*   **Hemiblocks (Fascicular Blocks):** Understanding left anterior and left posterior hemiblocks.
*   **Wide Complex Tachycardias:** Differentiating between VT and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy.
